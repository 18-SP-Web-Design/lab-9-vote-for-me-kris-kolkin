# Lab-9 - Vote for Me

You're trying to get elected to some office, but you don't have a lot of money, so you're designing your own website. You've got a basic skeleton but haven't filled in the details yet and it has almost no styling at all. Your job at this point is to do two things:

* Flesh out the content.
* Make it look good.

For this lab, your main task is to demonstrate your CSS skills. The content of the site will be the smallest part of your grade. Be as "creative" as you wish. Have fun with it. 

Included in this repository are a couple of HTML files which you may edit as you see fit. You will need to augment them with CSS and/or SCSS files. *You are not required to use SCSS*, and honestly, it's a little overkill for a small project, but you may if you like.

You do not have to use all of the tools and CSS features that are included in Chapter 5, but you should try to use as many as you can. In particular, try to implement a fluid layout, include a few images, and style the form so it looks nice. As with all things, you should overdo it either. Too much styling is just as bad as too little. Even if your content is funny or a weird, your website itself should at least try to do a good job of selling the candidate to the audience.

For your reference, look back at chapter 5 from the zy-text and as always, use whatever other documentation or resources you wish. When you are finished, re-upload your completed website to this repository.
